                <p className="text-2xl/loose col-span-2 text-secondary">I’m a 23-year-old frontend developer who’s been working professionally for nearly a year.
                    My journey with technology began as curiosity soon turned into a passion for crafting beautiful, responsive web experiences.
                    <br />
                    Currently working as a frontend developer, I focus on building clean, structured, and user-focused interfaces using tools like React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. I value maintainable code, clear structure, and strong logic. I’m quick to pick up new technologies and love solving challenges with a curious mindset.
                    <br />
                    This journey hasn’t been perfect — I’ve made mistakes, and I know I’ll make more. But I’ve learned that mistakes are just part of the process. What matters is the growth that comes from them, and the love for what I do that keeps me moving forward.

                    Stick around — I’ll be sharing my growth, projects, and learnings as I continue building in public.</p>
